# The Motivation

***
## The Background
With climate change as apparent as ever, world leaders have all come together to place some goals ...

***
In Korea, <p class="fragment grow"> <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold"> ... 314 fewer MMT CO2 emitted per year by 2030 </span> </p>

In the US,  <p class="fragment grow"> <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold"> ... 200 fewer MMT CO2 emitted per year by 2030 </span> </p>

In France,  <p class="fragment grow"> <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold"> ... 353kg fewer CO2 emitted per year by 2050 </span> </p>

 
<p class = "fragment fade-in"> 
<i style="color:darkred"> 
Sounds great, doesn't it?

### We haven't gotten much better at that either.

### Now, how do we make our electricity and energy more carbon-efficient? 
<p class = "fragment fade-in"> But first, a detour in what the rest of the world is up to... </p>

## Nuclear and Hydro seem to pull countries towards decarbonization
### Fortunately, we have hundreds of case studies on various energy systems!
